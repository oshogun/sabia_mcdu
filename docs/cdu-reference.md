# CDU reference

Key and LSK conventions, the full page map, and every CDU vocabulary table
for the Sabiá Windows client's CDU panel (`ui/`). For flow-oriented
walkthroughs, see [usage](usage.md).

## Key and LSK conventions

- **LSKs**: `L1`–`L6` down the left of the screen, `R1`–`R6` down the right,
  next to their matching row. A page names which rows are active; pressing
  an inactive LSK shows `KEY NOT ACTIVE`.
- **Keys**: `MENU` returns to the `MENU` page from anywhere. `EXEC` commits
  the current page's pending action (equivalent to its `R6` prompt on the
  CFG pages). `CLR` clears the scratchpad entry one character at a time (a
  long press clears it fully); it also dismisses a scratchpad message and
  restores whatever was typed underneath. `PREV`/`NEXT` (`PageUp`/`PageDown`
  on a keyboard) page within the current page's group, or step through a
  paged view (long message text, a route, a page of messages).
- **Physical keyboard**: typed characters and paste go to the scratchpad in
  the case typed. `Space` is `SP`, `Enter` is `EXEC`, `Backspace` and `Escape`
  are `CLR`, `Delete` is `DEL`, `PageUp`/`PageDown` are `PREV`/`NEXT`. `F1`–`F6`
  press `L1`–`L6` and `Shift`+`F1`–`F6` press `R1`–`R6`. After `Tab` moves
  focus onto a drawn key or LSK, `Enter` or `Space` presses that key instead;
  after a mouse click they keep their `EXEC`/`SP` meaning. Keys held with
  `Ctrl` or `Alt` are ignored.
- **Screen readers**: each LSK is named after the text beside it on the
  screen (for example `L1, SERVER URL, …`). A field that shows only a
  placeholder is read by meaning: dots as `SET`, boxes as `EMPTY, REQUIRED`,
  dashes as `EMPTY`. Page changes, scratchpad
  error and advisory messages, and warning or error lines on the message line
  are announced. Typed and masked entries are never announced.
- **Prompts render as they show on screen**: `START>`/`STOP>`, `SAVE>`,
  `PREFILE>`, `SEND*`/`CONFIRM*` (an asterisk marks a one-shot send, not
  repeatable while in flight).
- **Scratchpad vs message line**: typed text (`entry`) and an
  error/advisory overlay (`message`) are separate — clearing a message
  restores whatever was being typed. Entries are shown in clear, except
  `CFG NETWORK`'s token field, which masks input with dots only once `L2`
  has armed token entry (see the page map below).

**`CFG NETWORK` L2 (token) two-step entry.** `L2` on an empty, unmasked
scratchpad arms token entry: the scratchpad then shows dots as you type. `L2`
again while armed commits the typed value as the pending token, or shows
`ENTER TOKEN` if nothing was typed yet. Typing before arming leaves the entry
in the clear; pressing `L2` in that state answers `L2 FIRST THEN TOKEN` and
drops the entry rather than storing it as the token. While armed, pressing
`L1` or `L3` answers `TOKEN ARMED · USE L2` and leaves that field untouched.
`CLR` backspaces the masked entry one character at a time and disarms once it
empties; a `CLR` on an already-empty armed scratchpad also disarms. Changing
pages always disarms. URL and certificate path entries are never masked.

**`DL-CLEARANCE` paging change (this run).** Adding `SEND PDC>` to row 10 on
every page cost the route block one line per page: `PAGE1_ROUTE_LINES` went
5→4 and `MORE_ROUTE_LINES` 9→8 (`ui/src/pages/clearance-vocab.js`). A clearance
route of five to nine lines therefore now pages once more than it did before
this run, in exchange for `SEND PDC>` living on the page the clearance is
already showing.

Every DATALINK page holds its poll lease only while on screen. No key send
in DATALINK/FPLN is a single press: canned downlink, WX, loadsheet and
clearance all stage on one page, then send on a confirm page.

## STATUS vocabulary

Four axes, always present, never collapsed: the SimConnect link and the
backend uplink are independent things that fail for different reasons.

### App — is the sidecar alive, is the uplink meant to be running

| Label | Severity | Meaning | Action |
|---|---|---|---|
| `SIDECAR STARTING` | caution | Process just started, hasn't read the config yet | Wait a moment |
| `NO CONFIG` | caution | No config file exists yet at the resolved path | Fill in `CFG NETWORK` |
| `CONFIG INVALID` | fault | Config file exists but fails validation | Fix the named field and save again |
| `UPLINK STOPPED` | idle | Config valid; uplink not running | Press `START>` |
| `UPLINK ACTIVE` | ok | Uplink running | Nothing needed |
| `SIDECAR FAULT` | fault | The sidecar process died unexpectedly | Shell restarts it automatically; press `R5` if the restart budget is exhausted |
| `SIDECAR RESTART` | caution | The shell is respawning the sidecar after a fault | Wait; automatic |

### Sim — the SimConnect link

| Label | Severity | Meaning | Action |
|---|---|---|---|
| `SIM LINK STANDBY` | idle | Uplink not running, nothing attempted | Press `START>` |
| `SIM LINK CONNECTING` | caution | Trying to open SimConnect | Wait a few seconds |
| `SIM LINK ONLINE` | ok | Connected to MSFS | Nothing needed |
| `SIM LINK RETRY {ss}S` | caution | Last attempt failed (or a live link dropped); reconnecting in `{ss}` seconds, backing off 5s→10s→20s→40s, capping at 60s | Make sure MSFS is running |

### Backend — the Sabiá server (flight-data uplink)

| Label | Severity | Meaning | Action |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ACARS STANDBY` | idle | Uplink not running | Press `START>` |
| `ACARS CONNECTING` | caution | Uplink just started, no request completed yet | Wait a moment |
| `ACARS UPLINK` | ok | Most recent flight-data/event post succeeded | Nothing needed — the working state |
| `ACARS READY` | ok | Server answered a reachability check, nothing posted recently (usually because the sim link is down) | Nothing needed; clears once data starts flowing |
| `ACARS REJECT 401` | fault | Server rejected a post — token mismatch | Fix the token on `CFG NETWORK` |
| `ACARS FAULT {status}` | fault | Server rejected a post with another non-2xx status | Check the server's own logs |
| `ACARS CERT FAULT` | fault | TLS handshake failed | Fix the certificate path on `CFG NETWORK` |
| `ACARS NO COMM` | fault | Can't reach the server at all | Check the server is running and reachable |

DATALINK faults never appear on this line — see DATALINK vocabulary below
for its own state line.

### Pause — what MSFS is doing right now

| Label | Severity | Meaning | Action |
|---|---|---|---|
| `PAUSE OFF` | idle | Not paused | Nothing needed |
| `SIM PAUSED` | caution | Regular full pause | Nothing needed |
| `ACTIVE PAUSE` | caution | Active Pause (aircraft frozen, sim keeps running) | Nothing needed |
| `SIM MENU` | caution | Sim is frozen in a menu | Nothing needed |
| `PAUSE {flags}` | caution | An unrecognized pause bitmask | Informational only |

An unknown status/datalink state id (sidecar newer than panel) renders as
`?? <id>` at caution severity rather than blanking the line.

### Runtime cell (R1, right)

Beside the App axis on `STATUS`, a right-hand cell reports whether the Node
running the sidecar matches the Node the bundled SQLite driver was built for.
It is empty at idle/ok (no advisory needed) and shows nothing on a sidecar
that predates this cell.

| Label | Severity | Meaning | Action |
|---|---|---|---|
| `NODE {n} REQD FOR NAVDATA` | caution | The connected sidecar's Node doesn't match the driver's ABI, and the matching Node major is known | Install Node `{n}` and put it first on `PATH`, or set `nodePath` |
| `NODE ABI {abi} REQD FOR NAVDATA` | caution | Same mismatch, but the driver's ABI number isn't in the known-major table | Install the Node release for ABI `{abi}`, or set `nodePath` |
| `NAVDATA DRIVER FAULT` | caution | The SQLite driver failed to load for a reason other than an ABI mismatch | Reinstall the app; in a dev tree, `npm --prefix sidecar ci` |

Frames, datalink and traffic are unaffected by any of these — only navdata is
off. See [troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md) for the matching log text.

### Traffic advisory line

Not a severity axis; informational only. `TFC OFF` when traffic is disabled;
otherwise `TFC STBY {radius}KM` before the first sweep, `TFC {n} OBJ
{radius}KM` after one, or `TFC FAULT {radius}KM` if the last sweep failed.

## DATALINK vocabulary

**State line** (`DL-INDEX` row 4; also shown on `DL-THREAD` when no thread
is cached yet):

| CDU text | Hint | Meaning | Action |
|---|---|---|---|
| `DATALINK STANDBY` | | No DATALINK page has polled yet this session | Nothing needed |
| `DATALINK CONNECTING` | | First poll after opening a DATALINK page in flight | Wait a moment |
| `DATALINK ONLINE` | | Last poll succeeded | Nothing needed — the working state |
| `DATALINK NO COMM` | | No HTTP response reached the server | Check the server is running and reachable |
| `DATALINK CERT FAULT` | `CHECK CERTIFICATE PATH` | TLS handshake failed | Fix the certificate path on `CFG NETWORK` |
| `DATALINK TIMEOUT` | | No response within 8 seconds | Wait for the next poll |
| `INGEST TOKEN REJECTED` | `CHECK INGEST TOKEN ON CFG NETWORK` | Server rejected the token; DATALINK stops polling until config is corrected and re-saved | Re-enter the token and save |
| `DATALINK TOKEN NOT RECEIVED` | `TOKEN HEADER LOST IN TRANSIT` | Route answered but the token header never reached the server | Check any reverse proxy in front of the server |
| `DATALINK UNAVAILABLE` | `SERVER MAY PREDATE DATALINK` | Server answered, but not on a DATALINK-aware route | Upgrade the server |
| `DATALINK REJECTED 403` | | Server refused the request | Should not happen; report if seen |
| `DATALINK FAULT {status}` | | Any other non-2xx server response | Check the server's own logs |
| `DATALINK BAD DATA` | | Response wasn't valid JSON or the expected shape | Should not happen against a matching server version |
| `DATALINK NO CONFIG` | `COMPLETE CFG NETWORK` | Sidecar has no valid config yet | Fill in `CFG NETWORK` and save |
| `SIDECAR UPDATE REQUIRED` | `REBUILD SIDECAR THEN RESTART APP` | Running sidecar predates the DATALINK feature this shell expects | `npm --prefix sidecar run build`, restart the app |
| `DATALINK OFFLINE` | | No sidecar running, or it exited with a DATALINK request pending | Shell restarts the sidecar automatically |

**Scratchpad messages** (page actions and requests):

| CDU text | When |
|---|---|
| `NO FLIGHT PLAN` | A DATALINK action was pressed with no leg or flight resolved yet |
| `NO LINKED LEG` | LOADSHEET requested in flight scope, and the flight has no linked planned leg |
| `NO DISPATCH DATA` | The leg has no SimBrief dispatch release on the server |
| `INVALID ENTRY` | An empty or malformed ICAO was entered on `DL-WX` |
| `DOWNLINK SENT` | A canned downlink send completed |
| `LOADSHEET RECEIVED` | A loadsheet request generated new figures |
| `LOADSHEET ON FILE` | A loadsheet request returned figures already on file |
| `NOT A CANNED MESSAGE` / `UNKNOWN CANNED MESSAGE` / `FLIGHT NOT FOUND` / `PLANNED LEG NOT FOUND` / `DATALINK INVALID ID` | Server-side or scope-staleness faults; not expected from normal use |
| `DATALINK BUSY` / `DATALINK OFFLINE` / `DATALINK NOT SUPPORTED` / `DATALINK HOST FAULT` | A local fault in the relay between the webview and the sidecar, not a server response. `DATALINK BUSY` specifically means the relay already had 8 datalink/clearance/prefile requests pending (`PENDING_MAX = 8`) and refused a 9th, or the shell's own internal operation/stdin queue to the sidecar was full |

## CLEARANCE vocabulary

**Page text** (`DL-CLEARANCE-CONFIRM`, `DL-CLEARANCE`):

| CDU text | When |
|---|---|
| `CLEARANCE>` | `DL-INDEX` R5 prompt; always shown |
| `REQUEST CLEARANCE` | `DL-CLEARANCE-CONFIRM` title |
| `CLEARANCE REQUEST` | `DL-CLEARANCE-CONFIRM` heading above the leg/status rows |
| `SIMULATED PDC` | `DL-CLEARANCE-CONFIRM` marker, labelling the request as the simulated exchange it is |
| `LEG <id>` | The leg a pending or in-flight request targets |
| `SENDING` | The request is in flight |
| `CLEARANCE LEG CHANGED` | `SEND*` pressed but scope moved to a different leg since the confirm page opened; nothing sent |
| `SIMULATED CLEARANCE` | Result page marker |
| `ALREADY ISSUED` | Server answered with a 2xx and `created: false` — a clearance already existed for this leg, and this request returned the existing rows rather than writing new ones |
| `NOT FOR REAL WORLD USE` | Fixed last line of every clearance result |
| `CLEARANCE RECEIVED` / `CLEARANCE ON FILE` | Advisory after a successful send — new, or already on file |
| `NO CLEARANCE RECEIVED` | `DL-CLEARANCE` reached with nothing kept for the shown leg |
| `MESSAGES>` | `DL-CLEARANCE` R6 — opens the thread |

**Refusals** (local; nothing is sent):

| CDU text | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `NO FLIGHT PLAN` | No leg or flight resolved yet |
| `NO LINKED LEG` | The leg has no linked planned leg |
| `SCOPE UPDATE PENDING` | `R5` pressed while the scope hadn't yet caught up with a newly held prefiled leg |
| `INGEST TOKEN REJECTED` | Token already known to be rejected |
| `DATALINK NO CONFIG` | Sidecar has no valid config |
| `CLEARANCE LEG CHANGED` | Scope moved since the confirm page opened |

**Errors** (shown on `DL-INDEX`'s scratchpad after a failed `SEND*`; the hint
appears only on the reopened `DL-CLEARANCE-CONFIRM`, under `LAST REQUEST`):

| CDU text | Hint | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `PLANNED LEG NOT FOUND` | | The leg no longer exists on the server |
| `NO DISPATCH RELEASE ON FILE` | `IMPORT THE PLAN FROM SIMBRIEF` | No parseable dispatch release for the leg — e.g. a Little Navmap import with no SimBrief import run for it |
| `CLEARANCE UNAVAILABLE` | `SERVER UPDATE NEEDED` | Server answered, but not on a clearance-aware route |
| `INGEST TOKEN REJECTED` | `CHECK INGEST TOKEN ON CFG NETWORK` | Server rejected the token |
| `CLEARANCE TOKEN NOT RECEIVED` | `TOKEN HEADER LOST IN TRANSIT` | Token header never reached the server |
| `CLEARANCE REJECTED 403` | | Server refused the request |
| `CLEARANCE FAULT {status}` | | Any other non-2xx server response |
| `CLEARANCE BAD DATA` | | Response wasn't valid JSON or the expected shape |
| `CLEARANCE NO COMM` | | Can't reach the server |
| `CLEARANCE CERT FAULT` | `CHECK CERTIFICATE PATH` | TLS handshake failed |
| `CLEARANCE RESULT UNKNOWN` | `SAFE TO REQUEST AGAIN` | A sidecar or shell timeout on the request specifically — outcome unknown; pressing `SEND*` again is safe |
| `DATALINK NO CONFIG` | `COMPLETE CFG NETWORK` | Sidecar has no valid config |
| `INVALID ENTRY` | | Malformed request |
| `CLEARANCE IN PROGRESS` | | Shell or sidecar refused a concurrent clearance request |
| `DATALINK BUSY` | | The relay already had 8 requests pending (`PENDING_MAX = 8`) and refused this one, or the shell's internal queue to the sidecar was full |
| `DATALINK OFFLINE` | | Sidecar exited, or is unavailable |
| `SIDECAR UPDATE REQUIRED` | `REBUILD SIDECAR THEN RESTART APP` | This build's sidecar predates the clearance feature |
| `CLEARANCE NOT SUPPORTED` | | An installed custom host (not this app's own shell) lacks the clearance method |
| `CLEARANCE HOST FAULT` | | This build's own shell exe predates the clearance feature; restart the app |

## SAYINTENTIONS vocabulary

All strings below come verbatim from `ui/src/pages/sayintentions-vocab.js`,
checked mechanically by diffing the exported `TEXT`/`ADVISORY`/`REFUSAL`/
`ERRORS` tables (plus `SAFE_TO_PRESS_AGAIN`, `PDC_MAY_HAVE_BEEN_SENT` and
`UNKNOWN_CODE_TEXT`) against every backtick-quoted token in this section: 95
distinct non-empty strings are exported by the module, and all 95 appear
verbatim somewhere below. The reverse direction was checked the same way —
every backtick token below that is *not* one of those 95 strings is a page id
(`DL-SI`), a route/op key (`si-link`), a server `code` name (`NO_API_KEY`), or
a condition/template shown for explanation (`pendingMessages > 0`,
`IMPORTED <n> MSGS`), never a CDU string claimed as this module's own. Several
rows below reuse a string already documented under DATALINK or CLEARANCE
above rather than a new one — noted where that happens.

The CDU never collects or displays the SayIntentions API key (see
[security](security.md)); every "no key" string below points the operator at
the **web** app's Prefiles page, never at a CDU entry field.

**Page text** (`DL-SI`, `DL-SI-CONFIRM`, `DL-SI-PDC`):

| CDU text | Where it appears | Action |
|---|---|---|
| `SAYINTENTIONS>` | `DL-INDEX` R2 prompt; always shown, never refuses | Press R2 to open `DL-SI` |
| `SAYINTENTIONS` | `DL-SI` page title | — |
| `SI KEY` | `DL-SI` row 1 left label | — |
| `KEY ON FILE` | `DL-SI` row 2, key configured on the server | Nothing needed |
| `NO KEY ON FILE` | `DL-SI` row 2, no key configured | Set the key on the web app's Prefiles page |
| `LOADING` | `DL-SI` row 2 while the first `si-status` read is out | Wait a moment |
| `SESSION` | `DL-SI` row 3 left label | — |
| `IMPORTED` | `DL-SI` row 3 right label | — |
| `LINKED` | `DL-SI` row 5 left label | — |
| `LAST IMPORT` | `DL-SI` row 5 right label | — |
| `LINK FROM` | `DL-SI` row 7 right label; `DL-SI-CONFIRM` row 5 (link only) | — |
| `NOW` | `DL-SI` row 8 right (selected `?from=now`); `DL-SI-CONFIRM` row 6 | Press R4 on `DL-SI` to select |
| `SESSION START` | `DL-SI` row 8 right (selected default); `DL-SI-CONFIRM` row 6 | Press R4 on `DL-SI` to select |
| `<LINK` | `DL-SI` L4 prompt | Press L4 to stage a link, then `SEND*` on `DL-SI-CONFIRM` |
| `<UNLINK` | `DL-SI` L5 prompt | Press L5 to stage an unlink, then `SEND*` |
| `IMPORT>` | `DL-SI` R5 prompt | Press R5 to stage an import, then `SEND*` |
| `<RETURN` | `DL-SI` L6; `DL-SI-CONFIRM`/`DL-SI-PDC` L6 with nothing staged | Returns without sending anything |
| `REFRESH>` | `DL-SI` R6 | Re-reads `si-status` only, not the whole datalink poll |
| `----` | `DL-SI` placeholder for an unknown session id or time | — |
| `---` | `DL-SI` placeholder for an unknown count | — |
| `NEEDS ACTIVE FLIGHT` | `DL-SI` row 2 right-hand state line, and the scratchpad refusal on L4/L5/R5, in leg scope or with no flight plan | Wait for the flight to be detected (at FLYING); see the row 11 hint |
| `LINK AVAILABLE ONCE FLYING` | `DL-SI` row 11 hint, leg scope or no flight plan | Nothing to do until the flight starts |
| `SET KEY ON WEB PREFILES PAGE` | `DL-SI` row 11 hint when no key is configured | Set the key on the web app's Prefiles page |
| `CONFIRM LINK` | `DL-SI-CONFIRM` title, link staged | — |
| `CONFIRM UNLINK` | `DL-SI-CONFIRM` title, unlink staged | — |
| `CONFIRM IMPORT` | `DL-SI-CONFIRM` title, import staged | — |
| `CONFIRM SI ACTION` | `DL-SI-CONFIRM` title, nothing staged | Press L6 to return to `DL-SI` |
| `LINK SESSION` | `DL-SI-CONFIRM` row 2, link staged | — |
| `UNLINK SESSION` | `DL-SI-CONFIRM` row 2, unlink staged | — |
| `IMPORT COMMS` | `DL-SI-CONFIRM` row 2, import staged | — |
| `CONFIRM` | `DL-SI-CONFIRM` row 1 left label | — |
| `TO` | `DL-SI-CONFIRM` row 3 left label, over the target flight | — |
| `NO PENDING ACTION` | `DL-SI-CONFIRM`/`DL-SI-PDC` reached with nothing staged | Press L6 to return |
| `LAST REQUEST` | `DL-SI-CONFIRM`/`DL-SI-PDC` label over a kept failure | — |
| `<CANCEL` | `DL-SI-CONFIRM`/`DL-SI-PDC` L6 | Discards the staged action without sending |
| `SEND*` | `DL-SI-CONFIRM`/`DL-SI-PDC` R6, the one press that sends | Press once; not repeatable while in flight |
| `SENDING` | `DL-SI-CONFIRM`/`DL-SI-PDC` R6 while a request is out | Wait |
| `SEND PDC>` | `DL-CLEARANCE` R5 prompt | Press R5 to stage a PDC push, then `SEND*` on `DL-SI-PDC` |
| `SEND PDC` | `DL-SI-PDC` title and row 1 left label | — |
| `TO SAYINTENTIONS` | `DL-SI-PDC` row 2 | — |
| `LAST SENT` | `DL-SI-PDC` row 3 label over the kept sent text | — |

`SEND*` is used for the import too, even though an import is a read: every
action reaches the real SayIntentions upstream (D-6), so the panel spells "the
one press that sends a request" the same way everywhere rather than carving
out an exception for the one that happens to be a read.

**Refusals** (local; nothing is sent):

| CDU text | When | Action |
|---|---|---|
| `NEEDS ACTIVE FLIGHT` | Link/unlink/import pressed in leg scope, prefile scope, or no scope | Wait for a live flight; see `LINK AVAILABLE ONCE FLYING` |
| `NO FLIGHT PLAN` | Same action pressed with flight scope but no usable flight id, or an unreadable datalink state — same string as the existing DATALINK table above | Nothing to press yet |
| `INGEST TOKEN REJECTED` | Token already known to be rejected — same string as DATALINK/CLEARANCE above | Fix the token on `CFG NETWORK` |
| `DATALINK NO CONFIG` | Sidecar has no valid config — same string as DATALINK above | Fill in `CFG NETWORK` and save |
| `SI FLIGHT CHANGED` | `SEND*` pressed on a link/unlink/import confirm page, but the flight it targeted is no longer what the current rule picks | Return to `DL-SI` and re-stage the action |
| `PDC LEG CHANGED` | `SEND*` pressed on `DL-SI-PDC`, but the leg it targeted is no longer what `DL-CLEARANCE` shows | Return to `DL-CLEARANCE` and press `SEND PDC>` again |

The PDC send does not have its own `SCOPE UPDATE PENDING` refusal: it inherits
`DL-CLEARANCE`'s own rule of that name (CLEARANCE vocabulary above) by
construction, so a stale held prefiled leg is refused once, not twice, and the
two paths can't drift apart.

**Advisories** (a successful action):

| CDU text | When |
|---|---|
| `SESSION LINKED` | `si-link` with `created === true` |
| `SESSION RELINKED` | `si-link` with `created === false` — the flight was already linked, and the session was rebound |
| `SESSION UNLINKED` | `si-unlink` with `unlinked === true` |
| `NO LINK TO REMOVE` | `si-unlink` with `unlinked === false` — still a success, route 4 never errors on a missing link |
| `NO NEW COMMS` | `si-import` with `imported === 0` |
| `PDC SENT` | `si-pdc` success |

Two of the advisories above grow a numeric suffix: `SESSION LINKED`/
`SESSION RELINKED` get ` <n> PENDING` appended when `pendingMessages > 0` (e.g.
`SESSION LINKED 4 PENDING`), and a non-empty import (`IMPORTED <n> MSGS`,
otherwise `NO NEW COMMS`) gets ` SKIPPED <k>` appended when `skipped > 0`.

## SayIntentions error codes

Restated one row per code, because this is what a Reviewer checks against the
contract one by one (intake success criteria 5 and 6).

**The seven contract codes:**

| Server `code` | CDU text | Hint | Action |
|---|---|---|---|
| `NO_API_KEY` | `NO SAYINTENTIONS KEY` | `SET KEY ON WEB PREFILES PAGE` | Leave the CDU and save the key in the web app's Prefiles page — reachable in leg scope, on the ground, because `si-status` answers the key question without a flight id |
| `BAD_API_KEY` | `SAYINTENTIONS KEY REJECTED` | `CHECK KEY ON WEB PREFILES PAGE` | Same journey; the key exists but the server no longer accepts it |
| `NOT_LINKED` | `SAYINTENTIONS NOT LINKED` | `LINK THIS FLIGHT ON DL-SI FIRST` | Press `DL-SI` L4 `<LINK`, then `SEND*`, then R5 `IMPORT>` |
| `SESSION_CHANGED` | `SAYINTENTIONS SESSION CHANGED` | `UNLINK THEN LINK AGAIN` | Press L5 `<UNLINK`, `SEND*`, then L4 `<LINK`, `SEND*` — the old session id shown on row 4 is the evidence |
| `NO_COMMS_TO_LINK` | `NO RADIO CALLS YET` (advisory) | `CALL ATC IN THE SIM THEN LINK` | Make one radio call in the sim, then press `SEND*` again — the staged action is not cleared |
| `NO_ACTIVE_SESSION` | `SAYINTENTIONS NOT RUNNING` (advisory) | `START SAYINTENTIONS THEN RETRY` | Start SayIntentions and press `SEND*` again; this is an expected outcome for a pilot not running SayIntentions that day, never phrased as a fault |
| `NO_CLEARANCE` | `NO PDC ON FILE` | `REQUEST CLEARANCE ON DL-INDEX R5` | Go to `DL-INDEX`, press R5, `SEND*`, then return to `DL-CLEARANCE` and press R5 `SEND PDC>` |

**Other codes a SayIntentions request can produce** — transport, local and
shared-infrastructure codes, mapped the same way the DATALINK/CLEARANCE tables
above map them for their own requests. A local code appearing in more than one
op's table always renders the same CDU text everywhere it is used:

| Code | CDU text | Hint | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `si-upstream-unreachable` (`UPSTREAM_UNREACHABLE`) | `SAYINTENTIONS NO COMM` | | The server couldn't reach SayIntentions itself |
| `si-upstream-timeout` (`UPSTREAM_TIMEOUT`) | `SAYINTENTIONS TIMEOUT` | | The server's own 10 s SayIntentions timeout fired |
| `si-upstream-error` (`UPSTREAM_ERROR`) | `SAYINTENTIONS UPSTREAM FAULT` | | SayIntentions answered the server with an unexpected status |
| `si-upstream-bad-body` (`UPSTREAM_BAD_BODY`) | `SAYINTENTIONS UPSTREAM BAD DATA` | | SayIntentions' answer wasn't usable |
| `flight-not-found` (`FLIGHT_NOT_FOUND`) | `FLIGHT NOT FOUND` | | The flight id no longer exists on the server |
| `leg-not-found` (`PLANNED_LEG_NOT_FOUND`) | `PLANNED LEG NOT FOUND` | | The leg id no longer exists on the server |
| `invalid-id` (`INVALID_ID`) | `DATALINK INVALID ID` | | Malformed id — should not happen from normal CDU use |
| `token-invalid` | `INGEST TOKEN REJECTED` | `CHECK INGEST TOKEN ON CFG NETWORK` | Server rejected the token; same as DATALINK |
| `token-missing` | `SAYINTENTIONS TOKEN NOT RECEIVED` | `TOKEN HEADER LOST IN TRANSIT` | Route answered but the token header never arrived |
| `sayintentions-unavailable` | `SAYINTENTIONS UNAVAILABLE` | `SERVER UPDATE NEEDED` | A 401 outside the token's scope — server build predates these routes |
| `rejected` | `SAYINTENTIONS REJECTED 403` | | Server refused the request; should not happen |
| `http-error` | `SAYINTENTIONS FAULT` | | Any other non-2xx server response (status appended when known) |
| `bad-response` | `SAYINTENTIONS BAD DATA` | | Response wasn't valid JSON or the expected shape |
| `too-large` | `SAYINTENTIONS BAD DATA` | | Response exceeded the body cap |
| `timeout` | `SAYINTENTIONS RESULT UNKNOWN` | | Sidecar-side HTTP timeout; outcome unknown |
| `tls-error` | `DATALINK CERT FAULT` | `CHECK CERTIFICATE PATH` | TLS handshake failed; same as DATALINK |
| `unreachable` | `DATALINK NO COMM` | | Can't reach the server at all; same as DATALINK |
| `no-config` | `DATALINK NO CONFIG` | `COMPLETE CFG NETWORK` | Sidecar has no valid config; same as DATALINK |
| `sayintentions-in-progress` | `SAYINTENTIONS IN PROGRESS` | | Shell or sidecar refused a concurrent SayIntentions request |
| `bad-request` | `INVALID ENTRY` | | Malformed request; same as DATALINK |
| `busy` | `DATALINK BUSY` | | Relay already had 8 requests pending, or the shell's queue was full; same as DATALINK |
| `shell-timeout` | `SAYINTENTIONS RESULT UNKNOWN` | | Shell-side relay timeout; outcome unknown |
| `sidecar-exited` | `DATALINK OFFLINE` | | Sidecar died mid-request; same as DATALINK |
| `sidecar-unavailable` | `DATALINK OFFLINE` | | No sidecar connected; same as DATALINK |
| `sidecar-outdated` | `SIDECAR UPDATE REQUIRED` | `REBUILD SIDECAR THEN RESTART APP` | Connected sidecar predates the `sayintentions` feature |
| `host-unsupported` | `SAYINTENTIONS NOT SUPPORTED` | | An installed custom host lacks the method |
| `host-error` | `SAYINTENTIONS HOST FAULT` | | The host adapter itself threw or returned something unusable |

**Unknown-outcome hints.** `timeout`, `shell-timeout`, `http-error`,
`bad-response`, `too-large`, `unreachable`, `sidecar-exited` and `host-error`,
plus any code this build does not recognize at all (rendered as
`SAYINTENTIONS FAULT`), are outcomes nobody can vouch for: the request may
have reached the server before the answer was lost. Link, unlink and import
show `SAFE TO PRESS AGAIN` under those codes — a re-link rebinds the same
session, an unlink is idempotent, and an import dedups server-side. The PDC
push shows `PDC MAY HAVE BEEN SENT` instead: a second push is a real decision,
because it files a second CPDLC message into the live session and nothing can
be checked afterwards to find out whether the first one arrived.

## FPLN vocabulary

**Pilot ID and prefile outcome** (`FPLN` rows 2 and 10):

| CDU text | Hint | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `CONFIGURED` | | The server has a SimBrief Pilot ID on file |
| `NOT SET` | `SET PILOT ID ON SERVER` | No Pilot ID configured |
| `SENDING` | | The prefile request is in flight |
| `PREFILED` | | A new planned leg was created from the latest OFP |
| `ALREADY FILED` | | This OFP was already prefiled; same leg id |
| `NONE` | | No prefile attempt yet this session |

**Errors** (shown on `FPLN` row 2 or row 10 — note these have their own
FPLN-specific wording, distinct from the DATALINK table above even where the
underlying cause is shared):

| CDU text | Hint | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `NO SIMBRIEF PILOT ID` | `SET PILOT ID ON SERVER` | Server has no Pilot ID configured for this prefile |
| `SIMBRIEF ID NOT FOUND` | `CHECK PILOT ID ON SERVER` | Configured Pilot ID doesn't resolve on SimBrief |
| `NO SIMBRIEF OFP` | `GENERATE OFP ON SIMBRIEF` | The Pilot ID has no current OFP to import |
| `SIMBRIEF TIMEOUT` | `TRY AGAIN SHORTLY` | The server's own call to SimBrief timed out |
| `SIMBRIEF NO COMM` | `TRY AGAIN SHORTLY` | The server couldn't reach SimBrief |
| `SIMBRIEF ERROR` | `TRY AGAIN SHORTLY` | SimBrief answered with an unexpected status |
| `SIMBRIEF BAD DATA` | `TRY AGAIN SHORTLY` | SimBrief's response wasn't usable |
| `SERVER DB ERROR` | | The server failed to write the imported leg |
| `SIMBRIEF UNAVAILABLE` | `SERVER UPDATE NEEDED` | Server predates SimBrief prefile support |
| `INGEST TOKEN REJECTED` | `CHECK TOKEN ON CFG` | Server rejected the token |
| `TOKEN NOT RECEIVED` | `TOKEN LOST IN TRANSIT` | Token header never reached the server |
| `SERVER REJECTED 403` | | Server refused the request |
| `SERVER FAULT {status}` | | Any other non-2xx server response |
| `SERVER BAD DATA` | | Response wasn't valid JSON or the expected shape |
| `SERVER NO COMM` | | Can't reach the server |
| `SERVER CERT FAULT` | `CHECK CERTIFICATE PATH` | TLS handshake failed |
| `SERVER TIMEOUT` | | No response in time (settings check / clear) |
| `SIDECAR TIMEOUT` | | Shell-side timeout waiting on the sidecar |
| `SERVER NOT CONFIGURED` | `COMPLETE CFG NETWORK` | Sidecar has no valid config |
| `INVALID ENTRY` | | Malformed request |
| `PREFILE IN PROGRESS` | | Shell or sidecar refused a concurrent prefile request; not shown for a repeat press on `FPLN`/`FPLN-CONFIRM`, which is silently ignored while `SENDING` |
| `SIDECAR BUSY` | | The relay already had 8 requests pending (`PENDING_MAX = 8`) and refused this one, or the shell's internal queue to the sidecar was full |
| `SIDECAR OFFLINE` | | Sidecar exited, or is unavailable |
| `SIDECAR UPDATE REQUIRED` | `RESTART APP AFTER BUILD` | This build's sidecar predates the FPLN feature |
| `FPLN NOT SUPPORTED` | | An installed custom host lacks the FPLN method |
| `FPLN HOST FAULT` | | This build's own shell exe predates the FPLN feature |
| `PREFILE RESULT UNKNOWN` | `SAFE TO PREFILE AGAIN` | A sidecar or shell timeout on the prefile specifically — outcome unknown; pressing PREFILE again is safe |

**Prefiled-leg scope and advisories:**

| CDU text | When |
|---|---|
| `CLR PREFILE>` | Shown on `DL-INDEX` R1 and `FPLN` R3 whenever a prefiled leg is held |
| `PREFILE CLEARED` | Advisory after a successful `CLR PREFILE>` |
| `SIMBRIEF PLAN PREFILED` | Advisory after a `PREFILED` result |
| `PLAN ALREADY FILED` | Advisory after an `ALREADY FILED` result |

## Router-level and CFG scratchpad messages

| CDU text | When |
|---|---|
| `PAGE UNAVAILABLE` | A lazily-loaded page (CFG/DATALINK/FPLN) failed to import |
| `KEY NOT ACTIVE` | A key or LSK pressed with no handler on the current page |
| `COMMAND FAILED` | A page's key/LSK handler threw |
| `NOT ALLOWED` | An inactive LSK (`L1`–`L5`) pressed on `STATUS` |
| `INVALID ENTRY` | A CFG field failed validation |
| `L2 FIRST THEN TOKEN` | `CFG NETWORK` `L2` pressed with an un-armed, non-empty scratchpad entry; the entry is dropped rather than stored |
| `TOKEN ARMED · USE L2` | `CFG NETWORK` `L1` or `L3` pressed while token entry is armed; that field is left untouched |
| `ENTRY OUT OF RANGE` | `trafficRadiusM` outside `[1000, 200000]` |
| `USING DEFAULT 40000` | A non-numeric `trafficRadiusM` entry, applied instead of rejected |
| `CHECKED ON SAVE` | Advisory after entering `certPath` — the shell only checks the file's readability once the page is saved |
| `CONFIG SAVED` | A CFG page save succeeded |
| `SAVE FAILED` | A CFG page save was rejected by the shell |
| `CONFIG READ FAILED` | The config read at boot failed |
| `SIDECAR EXIT <code> - RESTARTING` | The message line after an unexpected sidecar exit, while the shell auto-restarts it |

## Timeouts relevant to the user

| Timeout | Value | What it governs |
|---|---|---|
| Datalink HTTP | 8 s | Sidecar's own request to the server for any DATALINK/clearance route |
| Prefile HTTP | 25 s | Sidecar's own request to the server for the SimBrief prefile route |
| Shell relay (general) | 12 s | Shell gives up waiting on the sidecar for a DATALINK/clearance relay before reporting `shell-timeout` |
| Shell relay (prefile) | 30 s | Same, but for a SimBrief prefile relay |
| DATALINK poll interval | 20 s | How often a DATALINK page polls while on screen (backs off further on repeated failures) |
| DATALINK poll lease | 65 s | How long a `watch:true` request keeps the sidecar polling before it stops on its own if no page renews it |

See [troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md) for what to do when any of the
above times out or shows a fault state.
