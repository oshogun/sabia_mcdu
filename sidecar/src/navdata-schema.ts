// ── Navdata schema: the DDL, verbatim ─────────────────────────────────────────
//
// NAVDATA_SCHEMA_SQL is a verbatim copy of a schema that lives in two
// repositories which cannot share code: this file, and src/navdata/schema.ts
// in the Sabiá server repo. The two copies must stay byte-identical. A
// column added on one side is not a compile error on the other, it is a row
// that silently stops syncing, so a schema change is one edit, two pastes and
// a bump of NAVDATA_SCHEMA_VERSION, in one change set. The version travels in
// every wire payload and a peer whose version differs is refused outright,
// never half-applied. A local database of the wrong version is not refused: it
// is a rebuildable cache, and the store renames it aside and starts again.
//
// NAVDATA_TABLE_COLUMNS restates the column names in TypeScript. It types a
// row for the store and, more importantly, it is checked against what the DDL
// actually created when the database is opened, so a botched paste fails at
// open instead of at the first batch that quietly drops a column.
//
// Pure data: no import, no I/O, no native addon. Importing this module is safe
// with better-sqlite3 absent.

-- Sabiá navdata schema — THE authoritative copy.
--
-- DUPLICATION HAZARD. This file is the single source of truth for a schema
-- that lives in two repositories which cannot share code:
--
--   * sabia_mcdu  (Windows client)  — sidecar/src/navdata-schema.ts
--   * sabia       (Linux server)    — src/navdata/schema.ts
--
-- Paste it verbatim into both. Do not hand-edit one side. The server repo
-- already lives with this hazard between src/types.ts and client/src/types.ts,
-- and it fails in exactly the same way: a column added on one side is not a
-- compile error on the other, it is a row that silently stops syncing.
-- NAVDATA_SCHEMA_VERSION below is the check for this: bump it on any change here,
-- and both sides reject a peer whose version differs.
--
-- Requires SQLite 3.37 or newer (STRICT tables). The sidecar gets this from
-- better-sqlite3; the server's better-sqlite3 ^9.4.3 bundles SQLite 3.45.
--
-- LICENCE / PRIVACY. On an install with navigraph-navdata in the Community
-- folder, every row below is Navigraph-derived. The database file and any
-- export of it are local-only: gitignored on both sides, bind-mounted into the
-- server container, never committed, never baked into a Docker image, never
-- used as a test fixture. Test fixtures are synthetic idents only.
--
-- UNITS. Distances and altitudes are metres, angles are degrees, frequencies
-- are whole hertz, timestamps are integer epoch milliseconds. Latitude and
-- longitude are WGS-84 degrees, longitude in [-180, 180]; nothing in this
-- schema stores an unwrapped longitude.

-- ── nav_waypoint ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
-- THE TERMINAL-WAYPOINT KEY PROBLEM, and why the key is what it is.
--
-- Measured: one ~350 km bubble returned 1349 waypoints with 1338 distinct
-- idents — LOC10 x3, 36LOC x2, CS25 x2, MA25 x2, CF10 x2 and four more. All of
-- them are terminal fixes repeated once per owning airport. All the duplicates
-- share ONE region (RJ), so (ident, region) is NOT a unique key and cannot be
-- the primary key. Only the owning airport separates them, and:
--
--   * requestFacilitiesList / subscribeToFacilities return ident, region,
--     lat, lon, alt and magvar. No airport.
--   * requestFacilityData(WAYPOINT) accepts ICAO, REGION and IS_TERMINAL_WPT
--     but has no airport member, and cannot be *addressed* by airport either —
--     its parameters are (ident, region, type) and nothing else.
--   * only the facilityMinimalList reply carries an owning airport, in
--     Icao.airport, and only for the ambiguous-ident case.
--
-- So an airport-scoped key would be unfillable on the path that produces most
-- of these rows. What every path does carry is the position: the list rows,
-- the minimal-list rows, the WAYPOINT facility data (LATITUDE/LONGITUDE are
-- accepted here, unlike on VOR) and the NEXT_/PREV_ endpoints of a ROUTE child
-- all carry lat/lon. The key is therefore position-qualified:
--
--   wpt_key = ident || '|' || region || '|' || latE5 || '|' || lonE5
--   latE5   = String(Math.round(lat * 1e5))      -- ~1.1 m resolution
--   lonE5   = String(Math.round(lon * 1e5))
--
-- Two distinct fixes are never within 1.1 m of each other, so this never
-- merges two real fixes; two rows for the same fix from two sources round to
-- the same key, so it never splits one. Negative zero is normalised to 0 by
-- Math.round + String, and both repos must use exactly this expression.

-- be re-sorted by distance or by fix name.
--
-- leg_type is the SDK's INT32 leg-type enumeration, verified against the MSFS
-- SDK AddToFacilityDefinition reference:
--   0 UNKNOWN  1 AF  2 CA  3 CD  4 CF  5 CI  6 CR  7 DF  8 FA  9 FC  10 FD

-- rule, and both repos MUST classify identically:
--   coordinate-bearing  1 AF, 4 CF, 7 DF, 13 HF, 15 IF, 16 PI, 17 RF, 18 TF
--   coordinate-less     everything else — they terminate on a heading,
--                       altitude, intercept, radial, DME distance or a manual
--                       termination, so there is no end coordinate to draw.
-- Coordinate-less legs are COUNTED and reported, never synthesised.

-- ── nav_coverage_cell ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
-- AREA-SHAPED coverage, for the opportunistic bubble harvest only.
--
-- Airport coverage is not here: the bulk airport list is world-complete
-- (measured: 41 871 rows spanning effectively pole to pole and the full
-- longitude
-- range, farthest member 19 424 km from the aircraft), and airport DETAIL
-- coverage is airport-shaped and lives on nav_airport.detail_state. The two
-- mechanisms are genuinely different shapes and are deliberately not merged.
--
-- Navaid and fix coverage accumulates one reality bubble at a time, so
-- "no navaids here" and "never harvested here" have to be distinguishable.
-- The grid is fixed and global: 0.5 degree x 0.5 degree cells,
--   lat_index = floor((lat + 90) * 2)    -- 0 .. 359
--   lon_index = floor((lon + 180) * 2)   -- 0 .. 719
--   cell_id   = lat_index * 720 + lon_index,  0 .. 259199
-- 0.5 degrees rather than 1: with 1-degree cells and the corner test below, a
-- single 200 km sweep records only 8 cells (measured in the prototype), i.e.
-- it throws away most of what it just harvested. At 0.5 degrees the same sweep
-- records about 33 cells and roughly two thirds of the disc's area. Finer than
-- that buys little and multiplies the per-sweep upserts.
-- A cell is marked harvested for a kind when ALL FOUR of its corners were
-- within NAV_HARVEST_RADIUS_KM (200 km) of the aircraft at the moment the
-- list for that kind completed. 200 km is a conservative inner bound on the
-- observed bubble: measured farthest rows were 346 km (WAYPOINT), 308 km (VOR)
-- and 305 km (AIRPORT).
--
-- row_count = 0 with a non-NULL harvested_at is a real, reportable answer:
-- the NDB list returned 0 rows in the RJ bubble (measured) while NDBs resolve
-- fine elsewhere in the world (CH -> 3 matches in FQ/K7/UR).

-- evidence than an exception and must be re-checkable.

-- simulator install at one AIRAC, never a permanent fact.
