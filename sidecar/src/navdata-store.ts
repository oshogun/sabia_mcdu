// ── Navdata store: opening, the rev discipline, and all the SQL ───────────────
//
// The navdata cache is a SQLite database beside the config file, in its own
// `navdata` subdirectory — never the config file's own directory, and never
// anywhere a test can reach the user's copy, because the location is derived
// from whichever config path the process was started with.
//
// FAIL-SOFT IS THE POINT OF THIS MODULE'S SHAPE. better-sqlite3 is a native
// addon bound to a Node ABI, and the sidecar is launched with whatever `node`
// the shell resolves, so a driver that will not load is a real Tuesday. The
// shell restarts a dying sidecar five times in a rolling minute and then
// latches a crash that needs a manual restart, so a sidecar that throws during
// module load would take frames, datalink and traffic down with navdata. Two
// consequences, both load-bearing:
//
//   * the `require` is lazy and lives inside a function. A top-level
//     `import Database from 'better-sqlite3'` compiles to a require in the
//     module body, which throws while this module is being loaded — before any
//     try/catch in a caller can run, and before the sidecar says hello.
//   * `openNavdataStore` returns null for every failure and never throws:
//     driver missing, ABI mismatch, unwritable directory, corrupt file. The
//     caller reports it once and does nothing else with navdata.
//
// WRITES. Every write goes through `write()`, which is one transaction and one
// rev. The rev is bumped once per transaction, not once per row, so the sync
// cursor stays a plain `rev >` comparison and a batch boundary means something.
// A transaction that changed no row does not bump it at all: a harvest that
// re-sees the same ten thousand rows must ship nothing, or the incremental
// stream never drains. Each upsert reads the stored row, merges it in code and
// writes only when the result differs.
//
// WAL. The database is in WAL mode, so the file on disk is not the database:
// anything that copies the file must checkpoint first, or it ships a stale
// epoch and replays an old write-ahead log over a newer one.
